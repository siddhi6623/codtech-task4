Task: CLOUD SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION


Overview of the Project
TASK: This project demonstrates secure cloud implementation using AWS S3 by applying IAM policies for access control, enabling secure storage, and configuring encryption to protect data.

Task Highlights

Configured an Amazon S3 bucket to serve as the secure cloud storage service, which is scalable and ideal for storing and managing data securely on the cloud.

Created IAM users with distinct roles — one with permission to access the S3 bucket (authorized) and another without access (unauthorized), to demonstrate access control.

Implemented IAM policies to manage permissions precisely, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions like listing, uploading, or reading files in the bucket.

Enabled encryption at rest using Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) to ensure that all data stored in the S3 bucket remains encrypted and secure.

Blocked public access to the S3 bucket to prevent accidental exposure of data over the internet, following best practices for cloud storage security.

Key Learnings

Gained practical experience with IAM (Identity and Access Management) in AWS, including how to write, attach, and test custom policies for real-world cloud applications.

Learned the principle of least privilege, ensuring users and services have only the permissions they need — a critical concept in cloud security.

Understood S3 encryption mechanisms, including the difference between SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, and DSSE-KMS, and when to choose each based on data sensitivity and compliance needs.

Practiced testing and verification techniques using AWS CLI — including checking encryption status, verifying policy effectiveness, and simulating access attempts.

Strengthened knowledge of securing cloud resources, aligning with AWS security best practices such as blocking public access, enforcing encryption, and auditing with logs.
